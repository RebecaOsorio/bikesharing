# City Bikes Sharing

**Overview of the analysis:**
Exploring New York was fun and a magical experience because of Citi Bike, and Kate suggested to start a similar bike sharing company in Des Moines, Iowa.
We found an investor that was very interesting in the startup, but he wanted to know more about the initial idea.

**Resources**
* Data Source: for the analysis we used the City Bike Trip History for August from [Citi Bike Trip Histories](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data).
* Software: Public Tableau and Jupiter Notebooks
* Dahboard: [City Bike Challenge](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rebeca.osorio.gonz.lez/viz/CitiBikeChallenge_16468125798210/TripsbyWeekdayperHour_1) and [City Bike Checkouts](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rebeca.osorio.gonz.lez/viz/BikesChallenge/CheckoutTimesbyGenders)

## Results:
Using the visualizations we have in the Tableau Story, weÂ´ll describe the results of each visualization underneath the image:

**Starting and Ending Locations**

We used the Citi Bikes Locations to map circle markers according to the Trip Count. In this maps we notice that the bikes are mostly used in Manhattan. 
But we can also find users in Brooklyn and Queens. <br><br>

The Peak Hours in August were from 8-10 am, and 3-8 pm. With a total of 1.220 thousand rides. <br><br>

We can see that the main market of the Bikes Sharing Model are men. And a fourth part of the total users, are women. <br><br>

And with this Visualization, we also know that the subscribers are the ones that  are actually using the service.<br><br>

In the Checkout Visualization, we  created a line chart that actually shows the hour of the day in which the bikes were checked out. This lines are also filtered by Gender. <br><br>

With this heatmap, we confirmed that the peak hours are 7-9 am and 5-8 pm. But now, we also know that the bikes are often used on Thursdays.<br><br>

In this Circle Map, we can identify how much each bike was used in August.<br><br>

## Summary:
The main market should be men demography and we should consider plans and discounts related to  subscriptions.

We also have an opportunity to increase the market by studying how we can encourage women to use the bike sharing service to explore and move through the city.

In the development of this Module, we found that the best hours to make the bikes maintenance are 1-3am all week. But also, in the weekends.

We can see that in general, the trips have a duration of aprox. 5 minutes.
